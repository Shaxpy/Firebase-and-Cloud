## Firebase-and-Cloud
I am trying to learn whatever I can about Client side and integrating with Cloud Firestore to keep up with the current scenario. 
I will use the knowledge gained to deploy my ML models on the web to show actual results from data retrieved from Firebase.

Because its fun!

Also helps me explore Real time processing of data

How to use this repo to upload code to Firestore:
1. Download the repo and install Nodejs on your system, add the data as .json file
2. Add your database url in the code of uploader.js ,Use [npm install firestore-export-import] 
to install the dependencies of Nodejs
3. Use [node uploader.js] to make use of the code
