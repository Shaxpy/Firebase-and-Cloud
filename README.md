## Firebase-and-Cloud
I am trying to learn whatever I can about Cloud Computing to keep up with the current scenario. 
I will use the knowledge gained to deploy my ML models on the web to show actual results from data retrieved from Firebase.

Because its fun!

#Also helps me explore real time processing of data.

How to use this repo:
1. Download the repo and install Nodejs on your system, add the data as .json file
2. Add your database url in the code of uploader.js ,Use [npm install firestore-export-import] 
to install the dependencies of Nodejs
3. Use [node uploader.js] to make use of the code
